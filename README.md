# Da Wuff Stash
 An unofficial windows client application for e621/e926
## Info
 This project is just a hobby project, I'll update it when I want
 
 If you have issues just go to the issues tab and I'll probably see it
 
 
 I won't probably maintain this project for so long
 
 WinForm is a bit slow at things
 
 
 Thank you for the trying the program though if you somehow did
